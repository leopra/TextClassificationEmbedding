Implementation is very easy and does not require any change of existent client processes . Our robots are targeted to work in high traffic of other machines and people these distinct advantages made us the most attractive solution on the AGVs market. Our solution consists of a regular electrical forklift equipped with autopilot system by RoboCV, and cloud-based service which optimizes task distribution among robots in real time. Integration with local WMS system is possible. The unique advanced technologies of RoboCV allow robots to work fast and safety alongside humans. Powerful online tools help to implement project painless and quickly. How it works? 1 Collect a map Warehouse visual map has to be created. It is a pretty fast and simple process - for this you only need to move a robot one time through all the warehouse manually, while it collects a data. 2 Create virtual roads and objects After the map is calculated, a layout of virtual objects (roads, pallets, etc) should be created, using user-friendly web service. Also you can sync the objects with WMS or other external system. 3 Connect robots The required number of forklifts are to be equipped with the autopilot subsystem (sensors, computer with the software). Then, all the robots should be connected to a cloud-based RoboCV server. 4 Create tasks User may create tasks for robots manually, using forecasting for the time of tasks\\nexecution. Also tasks can be created automatically by event or external WMS system. 5 Control results For completed tasks user can generate Excel reports, as well as analyze current and finished tasks using comprehensive statistics, real time representation on the map and smaprtphone App . Projects Major International 3PL operator The goal of the project is to reduce personnel costs and improve operation quality by introducing 2 automated pallet trucks to handle two types of processes: picking and transportation of pallets from the first tier of shelves to gates (unloading) and transportation of pallets from gates to shelves (loading).\\n\\nThe project consists of implementation of the X-MOTION NG solution, which includes 2 AGVs and cloud client-server software for the automation of 2 warehouse processes mentioned above. The project is\\ncurrently in the process of implementation. For the automation of the 1st process (transportation of pallets from the first tier of shelves to gates) the WMS system of the warehouse generates transportation tasks containing only 1st tier pallets. For the automation of the 2nd process (transportation pallets from gates to shelves) system operator creates tasks that only indicate gate number. Then, the robots automatically define the location of pallets next to the gates, scan their barcodes, and request a target space on the shelves from the WMS system. Having left the pallet near the shelf next to the target space, the robot transfers the task for lifting that pallet to a reach truck operator via the operator s personal interface a Tablet PC, mounted on the reach truck, which provides the tasks to the operator.\\n\\nThe project supposes an opportunity to further expand the number of AGV without any additional adjustments and implementations. This possibility of the gradual scaling the number of robots and\\nautomated processes is a distinctive advantage of the solution X-MOTION NG, which allows to make the implementation incrementally, thereby minimizing the risks for the customer . Company RoboCV s mission is creating autonomous mobile robotic systems for a wide variety of high frequency repeatable tasks of intra-warehouse and distribution centers logistics.\\n\\nOur ultimate goal is creating cloud platforms, receiving and processing variety of inputs, integrating robotics, existing vehicles, personnel , sensors, data into smart optimizer for logistic tasks in value-add layers over existing WMS, ERP, e-commerce, asset visibility and FM.\\n\\nThe first product platform, unique X-MOTION NG system, developed by our company and tested in various scenarios by major global companies (Samsung, Volkswagen, FM Logistic, top 10 Retailers) allows cost-effective automation of the shipping of pallet goods.\\n\\nRoboCV team has unique competencies in computer and machine vision, optimization and routing, business processes and logistics optimization, motion controls, algorithms, mobile robotics, firmware, IoT Cloud, AR/VR, Voice biometrics, Machine learning, LIDARs and RF/MW. We have PhDs from elite physics, math and economics institutions who worked for CERN, NASA/JSA/ESA. READ MORE History of RoboCV February 2015 - Round A investment of $3 million.

Create any logic visually Imagine you had the most powerful programming language available to you, with every logic function you can think of. Sensors, file operations, data functions, permissions, user input, animations everything. And then, instead of writing code and learning the syntax, you could just drag-and-drop the functions on a canvas. And that's it. It just works. Every single parameter or variable you may want to use in your functions is automatically available. Welcome to magic. Welcome to Composer Pro. Watch video on how it works 3. Bring your own data Data is in the core of every modern application. That's why Composer Pro was built around integrations and data transformations. First we made it dead simple to add your own integrations. Then be built some ready-made integrations to get started with. And finally we added a nosql development database for you to play with. Unlike the other solutions out there, we don't want to relay your data through our servers. When you integrate your app to your backend, it connects there directly. That's what we call zero lock-in. Watch video on how it works 4. Do magic with over 400 formula functions We took a simple concept that everyone knows and spiced it up with some magic. By combining the \"spreadsheet type\" formulas with built-in support for full application context, we've built the most powerful algorithm editor you've ever seen. Combine hundreds of data transformation functions with relevant data such as the device and system info, GPS location, sensor values, data properties and the application state. What can you do with it? Calculate a distance between two coordinates. Convert date field to a local format. Predict future values based on historical data. Calculate interest rates on a mortgage. Confirm the total price when checking out a shopping cart. Basically anything you can think of, and then some. Watch video on how it works 5. Publish apps to mobile, web, tablet, TV, desktop... Once you're done building your application, it's time to ship it. You don't need to have a specific operation system to build apps for certain devices. You don't need any software to compile your code. With our free-to-use cloud build service, you can just request a binary version of your native application in a few simple steps, and it's delivered to you automatically. It's never been easier. And if you want to deploy your web app, it's as easy. Just click and release.

Implementation is very easy and does not require any change of existent client processes . Our robots are targeted to work in high traffic of other machines and people these distinct advantages made us the most attractive solution on the AGVs market. Our solution consists of a regular electrical forklift equipped with autopilot system by RoboCV, and cloud-based service which optimizes task distribution among robots in real time. Integration with local WMS system is possible. The unique advanced technologies of RoboCV allow robots to work fast and safety alongside humans. Powerful online tools help to implement project painless and quickly. How it works? 1 Collect a map Warehouse visual map has to be created. It is a pretty fast and simple process - for this you only need to move a robot one time through all the warehouse manually, while it collects a data. 2 Create virtual roads and objects After the map is calculated, a layout of virtual objects (roads, pallets, etc) should be created, using user-friendly web service. Also you can sync the objects with WMS or other external system. 3 Connect robots The required number of forklifts are to be equipped with the autopilot subsystem (sensors, computer with the software). Then, all the robots should be connected to a cloud-based RoboCV server. 4 Create tasks User may create tasks for robots manually, using forecasting for the time of tasks\\nexecution. Also tasks can be created automatically by event or external WMS system. 5 Control results For completed tasks user can generate Excel reports, as well as analyze current and finished tasks using comprehensive statistics, real time representation on the map and smaprtphone App . Projects Major International 3PL operator The goal of the project is to reduce personnel costs and improve operation quality by introducing 2 automated pallet trucks to handle two types of processes: picking and transportation of pallets from the first tier of shelves to gates (unloading) and transportation of pallets from gates to shelves (loading).\\n\\nThe project consists of implementation of the X-MOTION NG solution, which includes 2 AGVs and cloud client-server software for the automation of 2 warehouse processes mentioned above. The project is\\ncurrently in the process of implementation. For the automation of the 1st process (transportation of pallets from the first tier of shelves to gates) the WMS system of the warehouse generates transportation tasks containing only 1st tier pallets. For the automation of the 2nd process (transportation pallets from gates to shelves) system operator creates tasks that only indicate gate number. Then, the robots automatically define the location of pallets next to the gates, scan their barcodes, and request a target space on the shelves from the WMS system. Having left the pallet near the shelf next to the target space, the robot transfers the task for lifting that pallet to a reach truck operator via the operator s personal interface a Tablet PC, mounted on the reach truck, which provides the tasks to the operator.\\n\\nThe project supposes an opportunity to further expand the number of AGV without any additional adjustments and implementations. This possibility of the gradual scaling the number of robots and\\nautomated processes is a distinctive advantage of the solution X-MOTION NG, which allows to make the implementation incrementally, thereby minimizing the risks for the customer . Company RoboCV s mission is creating autonomous mobile robotic systems for a wide variety of high frequency repeatable tasks of intra-warehouse and distribution centers logistics.\\n\\nOur ultimate goal is creating cloud platforms, receiving and processing variety of inputs, integrating robotics, existing vehicles, personnel , sensors, data into smart optimizer for logistic tasks in value-add layers over existing WMS, ERP, e-commerce, asset visibility and FM.\\n\\nThe first product platform, unique X-MOTION NG system, developed by our company and tested in various scenarios by major global companies (Samsung, Volkswagen, FM Logistic, top 10 Retailers) allows cost-effective automation of the shipping of pallet goods.\\n\\nRoboCV team has unique competencies in computer and machine vision, optimization and routing, business processes and logistics optimization, motion controls, algorithms, mobile robotics, firmware, IoT Cloud, AR/VR, Voice biometrics, Machine learning, LIDARs and RF/MW. We have PhDs from elite physics, math and economics institutions who worked for CERN, NASA/JSA/ESA. READ MORE History of RoboCV February 2015 - Round A investment of $3 million.

Create any logic visually Imagine you had the most powerful programming language available to you, with every logic function you can think of. Sensors, file operations, data functions, permissions, user input, animations everything. And then, instead of writing code and learning the syntax, you could just drag-and-drop the functions on a canvas. And that's it. It just works. Every single parameter or variable you may want to use in your functions is automatically available. Welcome to magic. Welcome to Composer Pro. Watch video on how it works 3. Bring your own data Data is in the core of every modern application. That's why Composer Pro was built around integrations and data transformations. First we made it dead simple to add your own integrations. Then be built some ready-made integrations to get started with. And finally we added a nosql development database for you to play with. Unlike the other solutions out there, we don't want to relay your data through our servers. When you integrate your app to your backend, it connects there directly. That's what we call zero lock-in. Watch video on how it works 4. Do magic with over 400 formula functions We took a simple concept that everyone knows and spiced it up with some magic. By combining the \"spreadsheet type\" formulas with built-in support for full application context, we've built the most powerful algorithm editor you've ever seen. Combine hundreds of data transformation functions with relevant data such as the device and system info, GPS location, sensor values, data properties and the application state. What can you do with it? Calculate a distance between two coordinates. Convert date field to a local format. Predict future values based on historical data. Calculate interest rates on a mortgage. Confirm the total price when checking out a shopping cart. Basically anything you can think of, and then some. Watch video on how it works 5. Publish apps to mobile, web, tablet, TV, desktop... Once you're done building your application, it's time to ship it. You don't need to have a specific operation system to build apps for certain devices. You don't need any software to compile your code. With our free-to-use cloud build service, you can just request a binary version of your native application in a few simple steps, and it's delivered to you automatically. It's never been easier. And if you want to deploy your web app, it's as easy. Just click and release.
